- [Instructor] Preparing your data for analysis is one of the most resource intensive requirements in data science. In fact, the general consensus is that data scientists spend 80% of their time on data preparation. That means the better and more efficient you become in data preparation, the more likely it is you'll be effective as a data scientist. Let's look at where data preparation falls within the typical data analytics project life cycle. The data analytics project life cycle is pretty simple. It starts off with evaluation, then you move into data preparation, then analysis and model building. Next implementation and then communication. There are six main steps involved in data preparation. Those are importing data, cleaning data, transforming data, processing data, logging data, and then backing up data. The first step is always to import the data you want to work with into your programming environment or application. And step two is cleaning data, which involves removing duplicates and removing out of range records, removing stray characters, and standardizing casing. The third step is transforming data. And that involves treating missing values and scaling and normalizing variables. It's really important to scale your data because you need to make sure that differing magnitudes among the variables in your data sets do not produce erroneous or misleading statistics. And this is a basic step in preparing your data for machine learning. There are two ways to scale your data. One is normalization and the other is standardization. Normalization is where you put each observation on a relative scale between values of zero and one. And this is where you would divide the value of the observation by the sum of all observations in a variable. The other alternative is standardization, which involves rescaling data so that it has a zero mean and unit variance. Step four is processing data. And that generally involves parsing data, recoding data, and formatting data. And step five is logging your data. And this is where you would generate descriptive statistics, log your variable information, and store your variable information. In terms of what type of information you need to log about your variables, I would consider detailing your variable name and statistical description, the format of the data, the method used to collect the data, the date of the data collection, the source of the data, the location, where the data is stored, and any other notes that you feel are relevant to your dataset. Lastly, you'd be backing up your data, which just involves creating a backup copy of your data and then taking it over to begin data analysis.


The “Intro to data preparation” video outlines several crucial points about preparing data for analysis in data science projects:

Data Preparation's Significance: It emphasizes that data scientists spend approximately 80% of their time on data preparation, highlighting its critical role in the success of data science projects. This underscores the importance of mastering data preparation techniques for efficiency and effectiveness in data science.

Steps in Data Preparation: The video breaks down the data preparation process into six main steps: importing data, cleaning data, transforming data, processing data, logging data, and backing up data. Each step is crucial for ensuring the data is accurate, relevant, and ready for analysis or machine learning modeling.

Scaling and Normalization: A significant focus is placed on the importance of scaling and normalizing data as part of the transformation step. This is essential for preparing data for machine learning, as it ensures that differing magnitudes among variables do not produce misleading statistics.


These takeaways are foundational for anyone looking to work in data science or machine learning, including transitioning into a Machine Learning Engineer role. Understanding and applying these steps can significantly impact the quality of your data analysis and modeling projects.
