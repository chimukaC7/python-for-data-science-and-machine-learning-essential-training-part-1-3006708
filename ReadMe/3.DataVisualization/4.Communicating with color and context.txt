- [Instructor] Now let's talk about communicating with color and context. The correct choice of color and context can really, really add a lot of value to your data visualization, so it's an important topic for us to cover here. Starting first with creating context with color. Color should be used strategically, sparingly, and consistently. We want to use color to draw attention to the most important parts of your data visualization and away from the parts that are not that important. The first and foremost rule you need to follow when you're choosing a color scheme for your data visualization is that you need to make sure that the color stage you choose to use in your data visualization are all from the same color formula. There are many different options out there for color formulas. Popular ones include monochromatic, analogous, and complementary, but then there's also split complimentary, triadic and tetradic and many other options out there as well. Color formulas are based on extensive color theory that's been adapted over hundreds of years, and so you want to use them in order to ensure that you're using a color scheme or a color formula that's going to be harmonious to the eye of the end consumer. You also want to make sure that you have some shades that are useful for drawing the attention of the eye and other shades that are more muted so that you can use your color strategically to attract attention where it's needed. In case you're looking for a good tool to find good color schemes to use in your data visualizations, there is an AI driven color matching tool called Colormind IO. I'll put a link for you here. I took this color scheme that you're seeing on this side from Colormind, and it's actually a very good example of something that could be used in a data visualization quite well. As you can see, there are two shades that really pop, purple and red, and the other three shades are muted or they don't draw a lot of attention, so you can use the muted shades to basically plot out data that is of lesser interest. And then the purple and red shades would be good for really showcasing whatever trend or finding that you're demonstrating. In other words, the part of the data visualization that you want to stand out the most to the consumer. All of the color schemes that are generated with a Colormind tool include shades that are within the same color formula. This tool takes care of that for you, which is very nice. Now, moving into annotation, you can see here an example I got from USA ID where they're basically using annotation to add context and tell the story around how the data is performing. Using annotations as context is useful for providing your audience some information about why the data behaves as it does. Annotation is especially useful in data storytelling and data showcasing because they add a layer of context and meaning to the data visualization that helps consumers understand what it is that you're showing them. Another way that you can add context to a data visualization is to introduce graphic elements. In this case, we're looking at a trend line, but also single value alerts and benchmarks are very useful in helping your audience understand the relative significance of the data that you're showing them. Let's talk a bit about the mechanics behind creating context in a data visualization. You can create context in your data visualization just by adding data on additional and relevant metrics. For example, if you were to be featuring some statistics on dropout rates in a particular region of a city, some data that might be a good contextual layer to add would possibly be data on the household and the parents' level of education, and if the parents were also dropped out of high school, because it would seem that if a child comes from a household where both of the parents or one of the parents dropped out of high school and did relatively okay with their life, that the child would also feel like dropping out of high school would be a viable alternative for them. So that would be an example of adding relevant data sets and additional metrics around what you're featuring in your data visualization. About why you'd want to create context. By adding context, you're giving your audience a deeper perspective and insight into what's happening with the situation that's represented by your data visualization. Other ways that you can add context are, again, like I stated, just adding trendlines, single value alerts, a strategic use of color and annotations. Added context is especially useful in data showcasing because again, data showcasing pieces are meant for analytical audiences that really want to put a lot of thought into drawing conclusions from the data that they're looking at. But that said, context is also useful in data showcasing, because usually in data showcasing, you would just add a little bit of textual context or maybe a trend line to clarify exactly what you're trying to tell your audience. You wouldn't expect them to go in and read multiple layers of annotation or to go deep into evaluating the visualization, but you may want to give them some text or markers in order to make it abundantly clear what you're trying to tell them with your data visualization. Here's an example of a good solid data visualization. What I really love about this data visualization is its strategic use of color. The color is done right. This data visualization is taken from Data Lab's agency, and they have really done a great job in using color to draw attention to what matters most in this piece. They are using more muted shades in order to underlie and support their data visualization for completeness, but they use the red and orange to really draw attention to the points they're trying to make within the data visualization. Now that you know the basics of data visualization, the types of data visualizations you can create, how to select optimal graphics and how to communicate well with color and context, it's time to move into the next section of the course where we'll talk about practical data visualization and how to build data visualizations using Python.


The video “Communicating with color and context” from the course “Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Essential Training Part 1” provides essential insights into enhancing data visualizations. Here are the key takeaways:

Strategic Use of Color: It's crucial to use color strategically, sparingly, and consistently in data visualizations. Colors should be chosen from the same color formula to ensure harmony and should be used to highlight the most important parts of the visualization, drawing attention to key data points while using muted shades for less critical information.

Adding Context with Annotations and Graphic Elements: Annotations and graphic elements like trend lines, single value alerts, and benchmarks can significantly add context to your data visualizations. They help in telling the story behind the data, providing insights into why data behaves in a certain way, and making it easier for the audience to understand the significance of the data presented.

Creating Context through Relevant Data: Including additional, relevant metrics can create a deeper context for the data visualization, offering the audience a more comprehensive understanding of the situation represented by the data. This approach is especially useful in data showcasing and storytelling, where the goal is to convey a clear and insightful narrative.


These takeaways can be particularly beneficial in your work at ZESCO Limited, especially when presenting complex data in an accessible and impactful way to stakeholders.
