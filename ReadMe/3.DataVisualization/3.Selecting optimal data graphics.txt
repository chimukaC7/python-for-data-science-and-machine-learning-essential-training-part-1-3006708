- [Instructor] It is time to talk about selecting optimal data graphics. You're going to use different types of data graphics depending on the type of data visualization you're creating. Again, referring back to the last section, you learned that you can create data storytelling pieces, data showcasing visualizations, or data art. If you were to choose graphics for data storytelling, appropriate graphics for this type of data piece would be things like pie charts, line charts, bar charts, even area charts, point maps, or chloropleth maps. A chloropleth map is a map that shows area boundaries. If you looked at a map of the United States, you would see 48 different areas outlined, that's a chloropleth map. Now, if you were to take a look at a map of the United States to examine major cities within the United States, you would see points to indicate where the major cities are located, that's a point map. The reason why these types of graphics are appropriate for data storytelling is that people understand what they mean. Again, going back to the purpose of data storytelling, that purpose is to share your findings with an audience of people who are generally not very quantitative or analytical by nature. Because this type of audience tends not to be very analytical, they generally want to be given the findings in a way that is comfortable and easier for them to understand. That's why these are the best type of graphics when we are creating data storytelling pieces. Now, in terms of creating data showcasing pieces, you have a little bit or a lot more options with respect to the type of graphics you can use here. Of course, you can use the same type of graphics that you would in data storytelling, but you also want to add more context to data showcasing pieces. In addition to pie charts, line charts, and bar charts, you would also want to include or could include things like histograms, scatter plots, scatter plot matrices, and even raster maps. To add a little bit of clarity here on what exactly a raster map is, I brought in a picture of a Doppler weather radar on top of a geographic map. Basically, what a raster map is, is it's a raster file that's actually made of an X and Y grid, which is filled with a variety of numerical values. The grid is X and Y. The numerical values are colored according to count. In this case, the raster is showing you that where it's red, the value is higher, and then as the value decreases, it goes from yellow to green to blue, and then turquoise. Raster coverage is just a coverage on top of a geographic map that provides a layer of information about one metric. Since data showcasing is intended for analytical audiences, STEM grads, analysts, engineers, quants, these type of people, audience members usually want that extra bit of information, and these would be an appropriate graphic type to use in the data showcasing piece. Okay, now let's look at data art. In terms of data art, like we saw in the last section, data art is intended for the general public or for activists, dreamers, and doers. They're generally not super analytical people, so we would want to keep it simple for them. You could use a line chart, a graph network, or a chloropleth map to communicate as the data graphic within data art. But honestly, most of the time when you see data art, the data is shown in some sort of weird or artistic representation that actually isn't a data graphic at all. The creator often finds some sort of artistic way to represent their data and what they're trying to present about that data. To try and make it just a little more clear about what I mean when I say weird or creative data visualization, I brought in this data visualization that was presented by Mona Challabi and TEDx at NYC. She was basically educating her audience on three ways to spot a bad statistic. But as you can see here, the state of the visualization is definitely provocative because it's kind of gross. Well, it's really gross, and it's also really, really creative as data visualizations go. In this case, the graphic represents the peak month of flu virus and the times per month that this season's peak since 1982. The creator is trying to make a point about when flu viruses peak, and they've created this provocative data visualization to get the point across. This is a fine example of data art. Let's now move on to the four steps to choosing the right type of data graphic when you're creating a data visualization. Step one is that you make a list of questions that your data visualization is meant to answer. Step two is to consider whether your data visualization type should be data storytelling, data showcasing, or data art. You would make that determination by thinking about your intended audience, who is meant to consume the data visualization. Step three is just to answer the question, "What data graphic types are preferable for this type of data visualization?" We covered this topic in this lecture here. Once you've answered that third question, moving into step four, you go ahead and you test out the different types of data graphics with your data and decide which graphic type displays the most clear and obvious answer to your question. Let me illustrate what I mean because it could sound kind of vague if you haven't seen an example. In step four, we're actually testing out your data graphic to see which is the most effective visual communication tool. Just look at this example. You see that you have two data graphics. They both represent the same statistic, but you notice that the data graphic on the right does a much better job of visually emphasizing the differences in values. On the left, you basically can't see any difference whatsoever, so it makes it very hard to communicate the data. You should always test your different data graphics to make sure that you use the one that is most clear and effective in displaying your data and the trends and patterns within the data. The graphic on the left below is definitely not the most effective choice.


The video “Selecting optimal data graphics” offers valuable insights into how to choose the right visual representations for your data, which is crucial for your aspirations in data science and machine learning. Here are the key takeaways:

Choosing the Right Graphics: It emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate data graphics based on the type of data visualization you're creating, such as data storytelling, data showcasing, or data art. Each type serves a different purpose and audience, from non-quantitative viewers to analytical minds.

Understanding Your Audience: The video highlights the necessity of tailoring your data graphics to your audience's needs. For example, data storytelling visuals like pie charts and bar charts are more accessible to general audiences, while data showcasing might involve more complex visuals like scatter plots for analytical viewers.

Testing for Clarity: A crucial step in the process is testing different types of data graphics with your data to see which one most effectively communicates your message. The goal is to ensure that your chosen graphic clearly and effectively displays the data, trends, and patterns you want to highlight.


These insights can help you create more impactful and understandable data visualizations, a key skill in your journey toward becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.
