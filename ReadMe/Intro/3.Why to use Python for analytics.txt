- [Instructor] Let's talk about why it's a good idea to use Python for working with data instead of any of the other competing coding languages or methodologies you could use to implement data science. First of all, let's look at what are your alternatives to Python? For data science, of course, you can use Python, which is the focus of this course, but you could also use R, Julia, and a program called Go, short for Golang. Looking into the definition of Python, what is the Python programming language? Well, Python is a high-level interpreted coding language that's useful for a wide variety of applications, and it's the official programming language of Google. The benefits to using Python are that it's extremely easy to learn and it's human readable. It's got an extensive array of well-supported data science libraries, and it's got the biggest user base of all data science languages. Also, it's useful in data engineering as well as data science. You can use it for building predictive web applications as well. It's basically quite extensible, and you can use it for a lot of different applications areas, not just data science. Also, another thing that's preferable about Python is that it's an extremely popular coding language. As of 2023, Python is the most popular programming language of all programming languages around. In the TIOBE Index, a measure of the programming language's popularity, Python ranks first, whereas the ubiquitous querying language SQL is ranked at position nine in popularity. R is another widely used language, especially in the fields of data science and research and statistics. But as of October 2023, R actually ranks as 17th in the TIOBE Index. And Go is ranked at the 11th place. Julia, which is a relatively new language that came out in 2018, has really been growing in popularity, and as of October, 2023, Julia ranks 28th in the TIOBE Index. So if you're using Python for data science, you're just going to be a lot better off, because when you get stuck, there's going to be a lot of people out there that are getting stuck in the exact same way as you are, and it'll be easy for you to find solutions on Stack Overflow. Also, the libraries in Python are super well supported because it's a popular language. It's the most popular language of all coding languages out there. And so these are just some of the advantages of learning Python for data science rather than R or its alternatives. Here's a Google Trends screenshot that shows you the difference between Python for data science in blue and R for data science in red. As you can see, R for data science has never been able to keep up in popularity with Python for data science. The nice thing about Python that makes it so desirable, and this is probably why most people are pursuing Python for data science, is that it's also popular for data engineering. As you can see here in blue, that is the search trends for Python for data engineering. Honestly, more people are searching Python data engineering than they are Java data engineering. Python's very, very popular for data science, but people are also interested in working to build out its functionality with respect to data engineering as well. So if you know Python, it's good for you because you can do data science and then you can expand into data engineering, and then you could get into machine learning engineering, another role we'll talk about later in this course, but basically learning Python first is just a really well-rounded decision and will be better for you and your long-term future. Now, let's talk about why use Python for working with data. Python is useful for data science, data analytics, and data engineering, like we just discussed, but it's also useful in a professional academic environment. Python is an open-source programming language, and so you can use it for web development, application development, and heck, you can even use it to build out your own games. So it's very open-ended. If you know how to use Python, then you can function in a lot of different types of tech roles. You don't necessarily need to stay in the data professions for the rest of your life and you could branch off into many, many different types of roles. The same is not true of other programming languages like R, Julia and Go. Those languages are more likely to keep you locked down and limited to working in a data science capacity, not extending much beyond that. And that's just another reason that I love Python for data science. Now, in terms of the main libraries that are used with Python for data science, for advanced data analysis, you'd use NumPy, SciPy, and pandas, and then for data visualization, the most widely used libraries are Matplotlib and Seaborn. For machine learning, in this course, we'll be using scikit-learn, but if you venture into deep learning later on in your data science learning adventures, then you would probably be using TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. In this course, you're going to be learning how to use NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. We're not covering TensorFlow, Keras or PyTorch because those are deep learning libraries and we're only covering data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning in this course.


The video “Why to use Python for analytics” provides several compelling reasons for choosing Python over other programming languages for data analytics and data science. Here's a breakdown to help you understand better:

Versatility and Ease of Learning: Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simplicity and readability. This makes it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike. Its syntax is straightforward, which allows you to focus more on solving data science problems rather than on the complexities of the programming language itself.

Extensive Library Support: One of Python's biggest advantages is its vast ecosystem of libraries specifically designed for data science and machine learning. Libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn are well-supported and constantly updated. This means you have a wealth of tools at your disposal for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, which are essential for analytics.

Community and Popularity: Python is the most popular programming language as of 2023, according to the TIOBE Index. This popularity means a large, active community is available to provide support, share knowledge, and contribute to the libraries. When you encounter a problem, it's highly likely someone else has faced it too, and you can find solutions easily online, for example, on platforms like Stack Overflow.

Wide Application Area: Beyond data science and analytics, Python is used in web development, application development, and even game development. This versatility means learning Python opens doors to various tech roles, not just in data science but also in other areas of technology. This could be particularly beneficial for you as you look to pivot into a Machine Learning Engineer role, offering a broad foundation to build upon.

Comparison with Other Languages: The video also compares Python with other languages like R, Julia, and Go. While each has its strengths, Python's combination of ease of use, extensive libraries, and wide applicability makes it a preferred choice for many in the data professions.


In summary, Python's simplicity, extensive libraries for data science, large community, and versatility across different tech domains make it an ideal choice for analytics and beyond. This aligns well with your career goal of pivoting to a Machine Learning Engineer, as Python skills are foundational in that role.
